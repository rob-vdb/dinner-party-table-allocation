# Dinner Party Table Allocation (December 2021)

This project was part of my Introduction to Object Oriented Programming in Java course. The project provided me with exposure to text I/O and exception handling in Java. The program reads in guest lists (with guest information) in the form of text files. The program then tries to find a table allocation for the guests that satisfies some simple rules.
